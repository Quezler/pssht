This directory contains several keys intended for tests.
There are various types of keys (DSA, RSA, etc.) with different key sizes.
The ones in the "encrypted" subfolder are protected using the passphrase "tests".
Other keys do not include a passphrase.

These keys where generated using the following command:
ssh-keygen -t type -b size -f output_filename -N passphrase

Note: some algorithms only support some fixed key lengths (eg. ECDSA only
supports keys of 256, 384 or 521 bits).
Note: omit the "-N" option and its parameter for passphrase-less keys.
