pssht
=====

pssht is a library that provides an SSH server that can be embedded
in other applications.

What we're aiming for:

*   Clean code (eg. PSR-2 & PSR-4 compliance, tests, etc.)
*   Extensibility
*   Compatibility with as much SSH clients as possible

What we're not specifically aiming for, but still interested in:

*   Completeness (like support for TCP port forwarding, TUN/TAP tunneling,
    scp/sftp subsystems, etc.)


Installation & Usage
--------------------

Download the `composer.phar <https://getcomposer.org/composer.phar>`_
executable or use the installer.

..  sourcecode:: bash

    $ curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php

Create a ``composer.json`` that requires pssht.

..  sourcecode:: json

    {
        "require": {
            "fpoirotte/pssht": "dev-master"
        }
    }

Run Composer.

..  sourcecode:: bash

    $ php composer.phar install

Run the server.

..  sourcecode:: bash

    $ php bin/pssht


Configuration
-------------

pssht uses the Dependency Injection component from the Symfony2 framework
for its configuration. Have a look at the default
`pssht.xml <https://github.com/fpoirotte/pssht/blob/master/pssht.xml>`_
for ways to configure pssht.


Compatibility
-------------

pssht supports the following features for compatibility with other
Secure Shell implementations:

-   `RFC 4250 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4250>`_
    |---| SSH Protocol Assigned Numbers

-   `RFC 4251 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4251>`_
    |---| SSH Protocol Architecture

-   `RFC 4252 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4252>`_
    |---| SSH Authentication Protocol

-   `RFC 4253 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4253>`_
    |---| SSH Transport Layer Protocol

-   `RFC 4254 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4254>`_
    |---| SSH Connection Protocol

-   `RFC 4344 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4344>`_
    |---| SSH Transport Layer Encryption Modes

-   `RFC 4345 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4345>`_
    |---| Improved Arcfour Modes for the SSH Transport Layer Protocol

-   `RFC 5656 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5656>`_
    |---| Elliptic Curve Algorithm Integration in SSH [1]_

-   `RFC 6668 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6668>`_
    |---| SHA-2 Data Integrity Algorithms

-   `zlib@openssh.com <https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-miller-secsh-compression-delayed-00>`_
    |---| Delayed compression until after authentication


..  [1] Only the ``ecdsa-sha2-nistp256``, ``ecdsa-sha2-nistp384``
    and ``ecdsa-sha2-nistp521`` curves over ``GF(p)`` are supported.
    Elliptic curve points encoded using point compression
    are **not** accepted or generated.


Integration
-----------

pssht is mainly intended for use as an embedded SSH server for PHP applications.
By default, only the bare structure for an SSH server is provided.
The application using pssht is responsible for adding it's own logic on top
of this structure.
