pssht
=====

pssht is a PHP library that provides an SSH server that can be embedded
in other applications.

What we're aiming for:

*   Clean code (eg. PSR-2 & PSR-4 compliance, tests, ...)
*   Extensibility
*   Interoperability with as much SSH clients as possible, but mainly
    with the OpenSSH client

What we're not specifically aiming for, but still interested in:

*   Completeness (support for TCP port forwarding, TUN/TAP tunneling,
    the scp/sftp subsystems, ...)
*   Strong security (peer reviews, security audits, ...)


Disclaimer
----------

This should be obvious from the get-go, but **DO NOT USE** pssht in production.
This project merely exists for two reasons:

-   First, I wanted to provide a """somewhat secure""" cross-platform way
    to expose `Erebot internals <https://github.com/Erebot/Erebot>`_
    for introspection purposes and I did not want to install an external
    SSH daemon.
-   Secondly, I wanted to learn more about the SSH protocol itself.

The implementation did not pass any specific security audit. In addition,
no attempt has been made to avoid some common classes of vulnerabilities, eg.
`timing attacks <http://blog.ircmaxell.com/2014/11/its-all-about-time.html>`_.
Not to mention that the PHP interpreter itself is known to be frequently
subject to `vulnerabilities of its own
<http://www.cvedetails.com/product/128/PHP-PHP.html?vendor_id=74>`_.

If you are looking for an SSH daemon with thorough testing and code
audits to integrate with your PHP code, we recommend that you look into
the `OpenSSH project <http://www.openssh.com/>`_.

If you still aren't convinced that you shouldn't use this code in production,
see `this reddit page
<http://www.reddit.com/r/lolphp/comments/1yvm6v/php_can_do_anything_what_about_some_ssh_mtgox>`_
which relates part of the story of a project similar to pssht by MtGox's CEO.

In no event shall the authors of pssht be liable for anything that happens
while using this library. Please read the `license`_ for the full disclaimer.


Installation & Usage
--------------------

Download the `composer.phar <https://getcomposer.org/composer.phar>`_
executable or use the installer.

..  sourcecode:: console

    $ curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php

Create a ``composer.json`` that requires pssht.

..  sourcecode:: json

    {
        "require": {
            "fpoirotte/pssht": "dev-master"
        }
    }

Run Composer.

..  sourcecode:: console

    $ php composer.phar install

Run the server.

..  sourcecode:: console

    $ php bin/pssht


Configuration
-------------

pssht uses the Dependency Injection component from the Symfony2 framework
for its configuration. Have a look at the default `pssht.xml
<https://github.com/fpoirotte/pssht/blob/master/pssht.xml>`_
configuration file for ways to customize pssht.

The rest of this section describes precisely which algorithms and features
are supported.

**TL;DR** here's a feature chart for comparison with OpenSSH:

-   |[x]| Services (2 in pssht; 2 in OpenSSH)
-   |[ ]| Authentication methods (4 in pssht; ? in OpenSSH)
-   |[ ]| Key exchange methods (6 in pssht; 8 in OpenSSH)
-   |[x]| Encryption algorithms (34 in pssht; 16 in OpenSSH) [#null]_
-   |[x]| MAC algorithms (20 in pssht; 19 in OpenSSH) [#null]_
-   |[ ]| Public key algorithms (6 in pssht; 14 in OpenSSH)
-   |[x]| Compression algorithms (2 in pssht; 2 in OpenSSH) [#null]_

..  [#null] The "none" algorithm has been excluded from those counts.

Services
~~~~~~~~

The following services are supported:

-   ``ssh-userauth``
-   ``ssh-connection``

Authentication methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following authentication methods are supported:

-   ``publickey``
-   ``password``
-   ``hostbased``
-   ``none``

Key exchange methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The PHP ``hash`` extension must be installed for
``curve25519-sha256@libssh.org`` and the ``ecdsa-sha2-*`` family
of algorithms to work properly.
Also, elliptic curve points encoded using point compression
are **not** accepted or generated.

and ``ecdsa-sha2-*`` family of algorithms to work properly.
Also, elliptic curve points encoded using point compression
are **not** accepted or generated.

Compression algorithms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following compression algorithms are supported:

-   ``none``
-   ``zlib``

Integration
-----------

pssht is mainly intended to be used as an embedded SSH server for PHP applications.
By default, only the bare structure for an SSH server is provided.
The application using pssht is responsible for adding it's own logic on top
of this structure.
